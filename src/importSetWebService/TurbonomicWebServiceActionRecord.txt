New Field Map
    This one needs to be added manually because it requires a script.
Use source script: checked
Target field: Sys ID
Coalesce: checked
Coalesce empty fields: checked
Source script:
answer = (function transformEntry(source) {
    var fieldMapUtil = new TurbonomicFieldMapUtil();
    return fieldMapUtil.findExistingSysIdFromFieldMap('x_turbo_turbonomic_turbonomic_action_record', source);
})(source);

Appears as the below in the field maps table of the transformation map
Source field                  Target field                      Coalesce   Coalesce empty fields
