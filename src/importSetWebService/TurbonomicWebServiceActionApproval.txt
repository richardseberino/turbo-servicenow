New Field Map
    This one needs to be added manually. The automap feature doesn't
    populate this.
Source field                  Target field                      Coalesce
u_updated_by                  sys_updated_by                    false


New Field Map
    This one needs to be added manually because it requires a script.
Use source script: checked
Target field: Sys ID
Coalesce: checked
Coalesce empty fields: checked
Source script:
answer = (function transformEntry(source) {
    var fieldMapUtil = new TurbonomicFieldMapUtil();
    return fieldMapUtil.findExistingSysIdFromFieldMap('x_turbo_turbonomic_turbonomic_action_approval', source);
})(source);
